                BeaverGram is the next popular social media platform started by and created for
                Oregon State University students. The goal of this database is to track a user’s
                account and to determine the user’s engagement with other users/followers.
                BeaverGram is designed to have users post images/text/videos that other users can
                interact with using likes/comments. Users can follow other users to view posts
                from each other.
            </p>

                This database for this platform is focused around finding the average audience
                engagement statistics, by tracking a user’s audience engagement.
                The database is meant to track how frequently an audience engages each individual
                post and the user’s profile. This allows a user to track any fluctuations in
                popularity.
